Currently, offloading storage and processing capacity to cloud servers is a growing
trend among web-enabled services managing big datasets. This happens because high
storage capacity and powerful processors are expensive, whilst cloud services provide
cheaper, ongoing, elastic, and reliable solutions. The problem with this cloud-based outsourced solutions are that they are highly accessible through the Internet, which is good,
but therefore can be considerably exposed to attacks, out of users’ control. By exploring
subtle vulnerabilities present in cloud-enabled applications, management functions, operating systems and hypervisors, an attacker may compromise the supported systems,
thus compromising the privacy of sensitive user data hosted and managed in it. These
attacks can be motivated by malicious purposes such as espionage, blackmail, identity
theft, or harassment. A solution to this problem is processing data without exposing it to
untrusted components, such as vulnerable OS components, which might be compromised
by an attacker.

In this thesis, we do a research on existent technologies capable of enabling applications to trusted environments, in order to adopt such approaches to our solution as a way to help deploy unmodified applications on top of Intel-\gls{sgx}, with overheads comparable to applications designed to use this kind of technology, and also conducting an experimental evaluation to better understand how they impact our system. 
Thus, we present TREDIS - a Trusted Full-Fledged REDIS Key-Value Store solution, implemented as a full-fledged solution to be offered as a Trusted Cloud-enabled Platform as a Service, which includes the possibility to support a secure REDIS-cluster architecture supported by docker-virtualized services running in SGX-enabled instances, with operations running on always-encrypted in-memory datasets.
