\section{Main Conclusions and Remarks}

As addressed in Chapter \ref{label}

As addressed in the cahpter 1 (introduction), our dissertations objectives foram …. 
To adderss the objectives we proposed …   System model and architecture … 
We implemented a prototype que foi feito desta maneia 
We used our prototype to conduct an experimental evaluation for validation purposes. In the evaluation we tested …



In conclusion we addressed all the objectives and goals proposed for our dissertation
From our observations we conclude that the system performs with a good balance between privacy concerns, trustability assumptions and operation performance, showing that it is possible to have a solution using in-memory KVS that can …. TIRAR PARTIDO das tecnologias … 

(plus example, only if this is the case)
We shown that the impact on the possible loss of performance is only (approximately) 10% overhead in the performance comparing with a similar solution running without privacy and trustability considerations

\section{Open Issues and Future Work}

Some open issues arise from our proposed solution and implementation status. Some of these issues can be divided into two different categories:
-	Extensions and additional observations using the current prototype (A)
-	Optimizations and imporvements on the current solution (B) 


4 ou 5 boas direções vetres de trabaho na categoria A

4 ou 5 max vectores de trabalho proposto como future work

-  Optimizing the TEEE-Enabled solution with REDIS with a more fonegrain granularity of internal REDIS components specifically ruuuning in enclaves, aviding the containerization of the entire REDIS solution. This work direction could minimize the impact on SGX-performance issuers … (SCONE) …  
This approach forces to a accurate reenginerring process of REDIS implementation, in rder to be more aprpoproate for this purpose.
- It woulbe interesting to evaluate te impact of the laveraged container-bases solution, to evaluate different impacts ondifferent existen soltions. 
a) Scratched base:  Grahene 
b) GRAPHENE.GCS and others … (/3)
c) REDIS foi esclhido por ser uma solução de refR~encia muito pouplar….    It woul be interesting to conduct similar evaluations with ther
existent KVS technologies, namely … , … , … 
d) It woulbe interesting to conduct a comparative analysis on the performance of SGX-Enabeld REDIS comparing with more recent
proposals in which the native KVS technology was designed and imooemented from scratch to be protected by SGX
For example:    1 [pedir ao prof KVS feitas para serem incorporadas com o SGX]    2 [pedir ao prof outra, ele sabe as 2] 



-distribuir o servidor em mais clouds
-testar outras merdas
- TLDR : 4 ou 5 cenas obvias tipo (em vez de medir isto assim, medir de outra maneira)

----------------

Persisted data encrypted, we only have in-memory

Each replica of the cluster KVS in different containers on different machines (theoretically will give the overhead of a single instance KVS)
