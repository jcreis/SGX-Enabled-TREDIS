\chapter{Workplan for the Elaboration Phase}
\label{cha:workplan}



In this chapter, we present our work plan for the elaboration phase of the dissertation. The plan is represented in figure \ref{fig:ganttPlannedTasks}. This plan was designed to meet the calendar of the second semester in FCT-UNL, while also taking into account personal vacation dates. As represented in the plan, the main activities related to developments and experimental evaluations of prototypes will be conducted until the second week of August. 
We consider to write a paper as an open possibility, to be submitted to a specialized workshop in the dissertation topic. Depending on the evolution of the implementation and experimental evaluation tasks we can consider a submission to Inforum 2020 or to another target.

The remaining time until the middle of September 2020 will be dedicated to final implementation refinements and final experimental evaluations on a cloud-provided solution, provided "as a service". The effort of the report-writing activities will be balanced and developed in different cycles in the period from the middle of April 2020 to the first week of September 2020. We planned the second and third week of September for the final revision of the dissertation report, before the submission to the jury. 

The tasks represented in the plan are described in more detail in the table represented in figure \ref{fig:taskDescription}. In this table, tasks are presented with a little more insight, while also referring the relevant dependencies.
