I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Henrique Domingos, for all the help and time spent guiding me throughout this work. I would also like to thank the institution FCT-UNL for all the years I studied here, years of constantly growth which prepared me to take the next step with confidence. A big thank you to my friends, from back home, from school, and all the ones who followed me throughout this university journey, specially Miguel, Tiago and Ricardo, to whom I'm greatful for all the tireless help and support during this seven years. Finally, my biggest thank you goes to my family, who helped me through everything since I can remember, who were always there for me and will continue to be, pushing me to achieve more and better things. And sorry it took so long!
