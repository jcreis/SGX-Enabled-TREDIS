We’ll look into more detail about existing technologies that approach this objective of granting security of data processing as well as storage (something like this), and how they work or can work together in a way to grant the idea of confidentiality and integrity of data.

(…)

In the summary, it’s expected to have a good notion of what has been developed in those areas to tackle this security concerns, as well as which of this thesis main points have already been addressed by previous work.

\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{TPM – Trusted Platform Modules }

A Trusted Platform Module (TPM), proposed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), is a set of hardware and software technologies that aim to create trust in a local platform \cite{sgxCloudThesis}. It is identified by an Endorsment Key-pair (EK) which is unique for every TPM, and also a Storage Root Key (SRK) that is used to protect other keys and data in the TPM. 

As for the hardware, a TPM consists mainly on a chip, found usually in the motherboard of most machines nowadays, that provides and stores cryptographic keys that can be used to grant integrity and data confidentiality to the system, as well as persistent and volatile memory to store these keys. 

As said before, the main objective of a TPM is to create the idea of a trusted platform. This will be  provided by three main services: Encryption, Authenticated Boot and Attestation. The first one is used for pretty much every aspect related with security and privacy. The Authenticated boot consists in booting the OS in stages, as a way of keeping track of which code is trustable through the usage of Platform Configuration Registers (PCR), that store the trusted software hashes. As for the Attestation, we'll see in the next subsection.


\subsection{TPM – Enabled Software Attestation}


TPMs enable the use of Remote attestation, which is the capability of one system to determine if other system can be trusted to run a particular piece of software as expected or not.

This is made possible by having a trusted configuration of state as reference, provided by the PCRs defined in the boot sequence, followed by a remote system that proceeds to challenge the trusted platform (containing the TPM) with a nonce. Then the platform creates a message with the nonce received previously and the existing configuration and calculates an hash value for that message. With an Attestation Identity Key (AIK), the message is then signed and sent back to the remote system, which then proceeds to decrypt the message with the EK public part, that then compares the result with the hash of the nonce plus the configuration it had at the begining of the challenge. 

If the hashes match, the remote system can then identify the TPM platform as a trusted platform.

\subsection{HSM – Hardware Security Modules}

Hardware Security Modules (HSM) are physical components whose main function is to provide and store cryptographic keys used to encrypt/decrypt data inside a system. HSMs can also perform cryptographic operations (e.g. encryption, hashing, etc.) as well as authenticate through verification of digital signatures and accelerate SSL connections \cite{hsmThesis}.

This modules are used mainly in large environment systems (e.g. large distributed systems) where there are a lot of machines communicating with each other, therefore creating a more needed sense of security. The inclusion of this modules in these big systems is actually a good idea since HSMs can also help servers relieve the workload coming from cryptographic operations. However HSMs don't quite guarantee the idea of absolute security, but increment the cost of attacking the system.

Although HSMs grant some extra level of security to a system, there's some drawbacks. One of them is the cost, where to buy one HSM the price varies depending on the sophistication of the security, plus the cost of maintenance makes it even more expensive. Another disadvantage is the difficulty on updating the module. Let's say a weakness was found in a cryptographic algorithm, it's hard to update the software in an already functional HSM to eliminate that weakness \cite{hsmPaper}.

\subsection{Trusted Execution Environments}

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an abstraction provided by both software and hardware that guarantees isolated execution of specific programs from other programs running on the same machine \cite{guiBorgesThesis}, but also from the host OS, hypervisor or even system administrators, preventing them from leveraging their priviledges and thus take advantage of the system. A TEE also grants secured storage of sensitive data, as well as remote attestation to make sure a given program runs as expected on a remote TEE. 

For a user to communicate with his program running inside an isolated environment, a key-exchange between the TEE and the user takes place. This way it is ensured both integrity and confidentiality of data during further communications.

This TEE abstraction can be achieved either by using a virtual machine monitor or by running security critical software (from whole applications to little segments of code) under protection mechanisms provided by hardware \cite{pcopThesis}. 

In the next chapters we will be looking into more dept about this hardware protection providers, that are responsable to create this trusted environments in the systems nowadays.

{\LARGE \textbf{~\\These instructions are outdated! Please see also the “template.tex” file!\\}}

This chapter describes how to use the \LaTeX\ \novathesis\ template (and the “\novathesisclass” class file).

Let's start with some simple suggestions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item No! You don't have to use this template to write your thesis.  You don't even have to use \LaTeX.  However, writing a thesis is serious stuff, and which tool you shall use to write it is not a decision to make lighthearted.
  \item \LaTeX\ is hard enough by itself.  This template aims at making your life easier, but not easy. If you choose to use this template to write your thesis, you are very welcome.  However, don't expect me to provide you help with \LaTeX.  Look for help with your friends (you have some friends, don't you?), or search the web, or try even to read some book(s) on \LaTeX. In the end you will certainly find the experience rewarding.
  \item So, don't forget, when you come to the point of “\emph{How do I do this with \LaTeX?}” look for help!  Google is your best friend. 
  \item If you believe the difficulty is related with the \novathesis\ template itself (and not with \LaTeX), please \textbf{do not} send me an email asking for help.  Please look for help in the \novathesis\ Google Group (URL) and the \novathesis\ Facebook group (URL).  If you can't find help there from previous posts/messages, then post your own question. Hopefully someone will answer you.
\end{enumerate}

Now, let's go to a major issue for Windows users.  Characters have to be encoded in files as numbers, and that is how character encodings were born. ASCII and EBCDIC standards are long lost in the past.  The world now uses UTF-8.  Well, not all the world… Windows is still stick in its \emph{codepages}, and “latin1” is what windows uses as the codepage for Western Europe. This messes up with the template. Please be sure you use an editor with UTF-8 support.  \emph{Go to the preferences/options/… of your text editor and set up its default file encoding as UTF-8.}

The \novathesis\ template is organized into files and folders. At the main level it includes the following files and folders:

\noindent
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\ttfamily}l>{\itshape}l>{\upshape}X}
novathesis.cls     & file    & 
The main class file. It will include additional files from \texttt{novathesis-files} folder. 
\\ 
template.tex      & file    & 
The main user file. Use this file as the main file for your thesis. 
\\
bibliography.bib  & file    & 
An example of a bibliography file. You may have has many as you want. \\
template.pdf      & file    & 
A possible result of applying pdf\LaTeX\ to the \texttt{template.tex} file. The template supports multiple types of documents (e.g., MSc dissertation, PhD thesis, …) and multiple Schools (e.g., FCT-NOVA, FCSH-NOVA, IST-UL, FC-UL, …) and each will produce different results.
\\
Chapters          & folder  & Examples of thesis chapters. Replace them with your own chapters.

Examples          & folder  & Some more examples of the use of the template for different document types and Schools. 
\\
Scripts           & folder  & Some (possibly useful) scripts for Unix-based systems (Linux, Mac OSx). If you are a windows user, ignore this folder (you may safely delete it if you want). 
\\
novathesis-files   & folder  & 
Additional files for the \novathesisclass\ file.  Unless you know what you are doing, avoid messing up with the files and folders inside this folder (except for deleting the unused Schools, see below). 
\\
\end{tabularx}

The \texttt{novathesis-files} folder contains additional files and folders that complement the main \novathesisclass\ file.  These are:

\noindent
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\ttfamily}l>{\itshape}l>{\upshape}X}
README.txt      & file    &
A file that should be read!  :) 
\\
fix-babel.clo   & file    &
Simple fixes to the \texttt{babel} package.
\\
lang-text.clo   & file    &
Translations of important strings used in the template.  Currently fully supported are Portuguese and English, but French is on the way.  If you add translations for your own language, please be so kind and send them to me. Thank you!
\\
options.clo     & file    &
Processing of \novathesisclass\ options.  \emph{Don't mess with this!}
\\
packages.clo    & file    &
Additional packages to be loaded into the \novathesis\ template. \emph{You should not mess with this!}
\\
spine.clo       & file    &
This file is loaded only if the option \texttt{spine=true}, and includes the typesetting of the book spine.

ChapStyles      & folder  &
Contains a lot of files, one for each chapter style.  If you really know what you are doing, you may add your own chapter style here.
\\
FontStyles      & folder  &
Contains a few files, one for each set of fonts (main text font, chapter font, section font, subsection font, etc).  If you really know what you are doing, you may add your own set here.
\\
Schools         & folder  &
Configuration files for each school.  This folder is organized into subfolders, one for each university.  \emph{You may safely delete all the subfolders except the one for your University.}  Then open the subfolder of your University and \emph{you may safely delete all the subfolders except the one for your School/Faculty}.
\\
\end{tabularx}

As stated above, the \texttt{Schools} folder contains per-university folders and per-school (faculty) subfolders.  Currently these are the available folders:

\noindent
